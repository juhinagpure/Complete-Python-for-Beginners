# Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user

a=int(input("Enter your number : "))

print ("The square of the number is :",a**2)
print ("The square of the number is :",a**a)

# print ("The square of the number is :",a^2) # This line is incorrect for squaring a number in Python, as it uses the bitwise XOR operator.
